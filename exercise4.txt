Teoric exercise:
    Question:  Investigate why FLANN can quickly handle matching problems.
    In addition to FLANN, what are some other ways to accelerate matching?


    Answer: FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors) accelerates matching problems
    by using efficient data structures (like KD-trees or hierarchical clustering trees) and approximate
    search algorithms. These techniques greatly improve performance compared to brute-force methods,
    while introducing only small, often negligible, errors in the results.
