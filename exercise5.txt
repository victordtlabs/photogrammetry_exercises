Teoric exercise:
    Question: In the feature point matching, mismatches will inevitably be encountered.
    What happens if we put the wrong match into PnP ? What methods can you think of to avoid mismatches?

    Answer: When incorrect (mismatched) 2Dâ€“3D point correspondences are passed into PnP (Perspective-n-Point) several problems:
    1) Pose estimation becomes inaccurate. The camera pose (rotation and translation) calculated may be completely wrong or unstable.

    2) PnP may fail to converge. Commom algorithms expect the matches to be accurate.

    3) Numerical instability. Even a few wrong matches can cause ill-conditioned linear systems.

    One option to avoid and handle mismatches is using RANSAC, which iteratively selects random subsets of matches
    and, during pose estimation, checks which points are inliers.
