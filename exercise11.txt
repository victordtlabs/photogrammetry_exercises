    Question: What is a Homography Matrix, how you can use that?

    Answer:
        A homography matrix is a 3Ã—3 transformation matrix that maps points from one plane to another
        in projective space, typically used in computer vision to relate the positions of points in
        two different images. It encapsulates rotation, translation, scale, and perspective effects between
        the two views. Homographies are useful for tasks like image stitching, camera pose estimation
        from planar markers, and augmented reality, where knowing how one image relates to another allows
        you to warp, align, or overlay content. It can be computed using at least four point correspondences
        between the two planes and refined using methods like RANSAC to handle mismatches.
