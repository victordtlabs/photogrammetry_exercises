Teoric exercise:
    Question:What are the problems you will face when trying to match ORB with SIFT features?

    Answer: 
    Some of the problems :
    1. Descriptor Type Mismatch:
        ORB uses binary descriptors while SIFT uses floating-point descriptors (128-dimensional float32 vectors).
        Matching these directly is not valid because their representations lie in different spaces.

    2. Distance Metric Incompatibility
        ORB descriptors are best matched using Hamming distance while  SIFT descriptors are matched using Euclidean (L2) distance.

    3. Descriptor Dimension Mismatch
        ORB: 256-bit (or 32-byte) descriptors.
        SIFT: 128-float (512-byte) descriptors.

    4. Inconsistent Keypoint Localization
        SIFT tends to find more scale- and rotation-invariant keypoints.
        ORB tends to find faster but less robust keypoints.

    5. Incompatible Feature Distributions
        ORB tends to give more features in high-contrast corners.
        SIFT is better at blobs and textured areas.
